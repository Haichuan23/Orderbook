# Orderbook

I have learned some quant finance skills in my spare time. This folder is used to store some relevant 
projects/practiecs I have been working on.

================ Project 1: Orderbook ===================

I have created an API which takes real-time Coinbase data as input and outputs the five best bid/ask price.
This is used for my own coding practice. It does not serve as a financial advice and should not be used as a 
tool for financial practices.
